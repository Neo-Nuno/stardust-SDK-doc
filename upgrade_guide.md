## Updating with a newly released package

In order to update your sdk to a newer release version all you have to do is download the new release version package and import it into unity. You don't need to delete the previous package as Unity replaces only the files that changed.

### Downloading the latest release package

- Go over to our SDK repository [releases](https://github.com/Neogoma/stardust-SDK/releases/latest).
- Click on the latest **.unitypackage** file to download the unity package.

- Click "All" and "Import" Unity should replace any files with changes or add new files to the existing package.

### Troubleshooting 

If you're having issues with updating your package or you're using an older version of the package it's recommended that you delete the **Neogoma** folder entirely from your project and then import the package.
